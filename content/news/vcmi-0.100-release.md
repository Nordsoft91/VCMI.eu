## We're happy to announce new release!

Few years passed after we released VCMI 0.99 and now it's time for a new release.
Tons of changes, improvements, and fixes have been introduced during that time, it's even hard to recall all of them.
However, we'd like to highlight several major changes.

## Game engine
Lodestar grail finally can reveal all the map!
We were also working hard to track down and fixed the most of the crashes constantly hurting VCMI gameplay. Now they are rare beasts but if you manage to find one do not hesitate to [report it](https://bugs.vcmi.eu)!

## Adventure map
Hero exchange window has got a few additional buttons and keyboard shortcuts to ease army and artifact exchange. If you do not see them after installing the release ensure you have latest [VCMI essentials mod](https://wiki.vcmi.eu/Mod_list#Utilities).

## Artificial intellengence
You are welcome to try an alternative AI algorithm called Nullkiller which shows itself well on small and medium maps. For larger maps you should better go with classic VCAI computer player which was also significantly improved, so just choose from the laucher settings whatever you like and enjoy.

## Mods and new terrains
VCMI opens broad opportunitites for modding. Since the last release we significantly empowered the mod system.
Among various gameplay tools we introduced support of new terrains. It is a natural evolution of new towns as they need to have unique terrains, battlefields, mines and map objects. This feature required deep refactoring of game engine so all saves you made before release 0.100 will not be compatible. So it's a good reason to make new ones!

## Random Maps Generator
RMG also has undergone huge changes. First of all, normal and islands water options are supported now.
Secondary, as mods can introduce new terrains and objects, RNG has got powerful algorithms to generate new terrain patches and to place new objects provided by mods. And finally, we improved generator in terms of aesthetics, obstacles placement and stability as well.

## TBD Alsphat mod???
TBD - I suggest to make "official" mod demonstrating new abilities.
On my opinion, we need to make fine-quality mod with new town, new terrain, battlefields, mines, map objects (asphalt + forge for example). Also, we need to prepare some scenarios/maps (or even campaign) and some art (main menu?)
