## Big update before 2023!
 
Three months passed since our previous release and we observed many downloads and quite big interest to the project from the community.
We want to say thank you for that and willing for more! Such support realy motivates us so we were able to increase our efforts towards new features and would like to share with you one more big update this year.

## iOS support
VCMI supports one more platfform! Now you can play heroes on your iPad or iPhone and it'll have all game mechanics, including mods. Installation is not so simple as it could be using embedded app store but it definetely worth to make several simple steps from this [instruction](https://wiki.vcmi.eu/Installation_on_iOS) and it will be easier than expected!

## Online multiplayer
We overcomed most of challenges on a way to multiplayer so it's finally possible to play VCMI with your friends or with random people at Windows, MacOS, Linux or iOS. You can play over local network or use lobby mode from Launcher to play over internet.

## Map editor
Map editor for VCMI was rewritten in order to be cross-platform (currently works on Windows, Mac and Linux) and support mods. Map editor is included into installation package so everyone can create and share their own scenarios.
 
## Game engine
We are conitinuing investing into game stability, tons of bugs were addressed, but don't forget to [report](https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi/issues) about problem if it appears. Version 1.1 has many aestetics improvements, among them along-awaited ray shooting, tower icons, fixes for battle effects. Music isn't playing from the beggining while switching active screen and you can listen legendary soundtrack in the same way as in original game. Worth to mention that performance of random map generation got severe boost which was quite annoying.
 
## Artificial intelligence
Nullkiller AI in combination with Battle AI is not only more stable but get smarter on the battlefield. Enemy hero may consider winning chances as poor and prefer to escape.
 
## And many others
Update is not limited with highlighted improvements, almost every game aspect has undergone changes, detailed backlog is on [release page](https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi/releases/tag/1.1.0). Of course, new features and game in common maybe are still not in ideal state but we want people enjoy them and our team will continue doing the best as we can. In turn, we are looking forward for feedback and maybe even contribution into this wonderful project from anyone!

VCMI team wishes you happy New Year and will meet in 2023!
