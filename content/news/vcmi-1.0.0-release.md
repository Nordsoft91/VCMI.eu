## We're happy to announce new release!

Few years passed after we released VCMI 0.99 and now it's time for a new release.
Tons of changes, improvements, and fixes have been introduced during that time, it's even hard to recall all of them.
However, we'd like to highlight several major changes.

## Game engine
Lodestar grail finally can reveal all the map!
We were also working hard to track down and fixed the most of the crashes constantly hurting VCMI gameplay. Now they are rare beasts but if you manage to find one do not hesitate to [report it](https://bugs.vcmi.eu)!

## Adventure map
Hero exchange window has got a few additional buttons and keyboard shortcuts to ease army and artifact exchange. If you do not see them after installing the release ensure you have latest [VCMI extras](https://github.com/vcmi-mods/vcmi-extras).

## Artificial intellengence
You are welcome to try an alternative AI algorithm called Nullkiller which shows itself well on small and medium maps. For larger maps you should better go with classic VCAI computer player which was also significantly improved, so just choose from the laucher settings whatever you like and enjoy.

## Mods and new terrains
VCMI opens broad opportunitites for modding. Since the last release we significantly empowered the mod system.
Among various gameplay tools we introduced support of new terrains. It is a natural evolution of new towns as they need to have unique terrains, battlefields, mines and map objects. This feature required deep refactoring of game engine so all saves you made before release 1.00 will not be compatible. So it's a good reason to make new ones!

## Random Maps Generator
RMG also has undergone huge changes. First of all, normal and islands water options are supported now.
Secondary, as mods can introduce new terrains and objects, RMG has got powerful algorithms to generate new terrain patches and to place new objects provided by mods. And finally, we improved generator in terms of aesthetics, obstacles placement and stability as well.

## Launcher
Good news! We reconsidered our release policy to make releases more frequently and introduced update notification system into lanucher in order to make everybody aware about our new features and fixes. In addition to that, launcher works now with our new [mod repository on GitHub](https://github.com/vcmi-mods) and you can follow for updates in your favorite mods too!

## Join us!
The project is now actively maintained once again. There are several active contributors working on new amazing features. Not everything made it into this release so stay tuned for the next announcements!

On top of a shorter release cycle, we also want to tell you that we slowly started using GitHub built-in tools for bug tracking and project management. Now development activities and release milestones will be more transparent. As always we are open to all contributors who wish to help us move VCMI forward. You can help with both programming or contributing new mods to the repository. We will happy to see you in our team.
